    "\n",
    "1. Read the assignment instructions on Canvas [UA2 - Instructions for TOWS analysis report assignment (Assign. 2)](https://canvas.qut.edu.au/courses/14658/pages/ua2-instructions-for-tows-analysis-report-assignment-assign-2).\n",
    "2. Complete the section below with your personal details (and run the cell)\n",
    "3. Use the provided data sources for your analysis. You may supplement this with additional relevant data if you like (but this is not required).\n",
    "4. Ensure that you include at least 1 complete analysis using *structured* data to identify *strengths* and/or *weaknesses*. Include appropriate visualisation. Add cells as required to the relevant sections.\n",
    "5. Ensure that you include at least 1 complete analysis using *semi/unstructured* data to identify *opportunities* and/or *threats*. Include appropriate visualisation. Add cells as required to the relevant sections.\n",
    "6. Ensure that you include at least 1 detailed actionable recommendation from a TOWS analysis using your data analytics from steps 3 & 4. Depending on how you approach the scenario, you may find a group of actionable recommendations may contribute to a larger strategic recommendation that addresses the scenario. Your recommendation/s should also address relevant human factors and potential ethical concerns that should be taken into account by the business decision-makers. Ensure that you write your recommendation/s in a way that is appropriate for reporting to stakeholders.\n",
    "7. Ensure that you use markdown cells to document your thinking and decision making throughout the analysis process. Be clear on how your decisions are working towards addressing the business concern.\n",
    "8. Ensure that you undertake a peer review process and complete the peer review section.\n",
    "9. Before handing in your notebook, clear all cell outputs and run the complete notebook. Ensure that it runs without errors and that all output is displaying. **IMPORTANT:** It is your responsibility to ensure that the notebook is in a state that clearly meets the criteria. It is not the responsibility of the marker to try and fix errors in your notebook in order for it to meet criteria. *Not attending to this point could result in lower grades (even if you have completed the required analysis).*\n",
    "10. Right-click on your notebook name (in file viewer) and select download. Ensure that your name and student ID are on the file, and then upload to the appropriate assignment upload link in blackboard."
