    "> Our research, which has involved studying more than 50 international organizations in a variety of industries, has identified an alternative approach to big data and analytics projects that allows companies to continually exploit data in new ways. Instead of the deployment of technology, it focuses on the exploration of information. And rather than viewing information as a resource that resides in databases—which works well for designing and implementing conventional IT systems—it sees information as something that people themselves make valuable.\n",
