    "> Steven Sasson invented the first self-contained digital camera at Eastman Kodak in 1975. It weighed 8 pounds (3.6 kg) and had only 100 Ã— 100 resolution (0.01 megapixels). The image was recorded onto a cassette tape and this process took 23 seconds. His camera took images in black-and-white. It used a battery for power, so it was entirely self-contained.[3] As he set out on his design project, what he envisioned for the future was a camera without mechanical moving parts (although his device did have moving parts, such as the tape drive).[4]\n",
