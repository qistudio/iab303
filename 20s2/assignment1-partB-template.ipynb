    "1. Your small business client is a local Brisbane coffee shop which is gaining popularity. The owner is wanting to capitalise on this popularity by opening two drive-through coffee outlets on busy Brisbane roads in two of the following areas (Bayside, Inner North, Inner South, or Western Suburbs). They want to know what location might be best, and why, and the location of competitors and how they are marketing their products.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Your company specialises in travel advise for tourists coming to Australia. They are looking to create an app that provides low cost experiences around Brisbane by linking together public transport, public parks and spaces, museums, galleries, and also free public events. They would like to know if this idea is possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A group of surfers want to start a business that connects tourists with a 24 hour surfing experience on north or south coasts, involving over night accommodation and transport to a local surf spot. In order to deliver best experience within a fixed cost, they need to balance distance and traffic with weather and wave height. They want to know the best period of the year to run this service, which areas should be used for the overnight accommodation, and whether they can get near realtime data to allow them to decide whe which beach they are travelling to before  5:00am (their planned pickup time from the hotel).\n",
