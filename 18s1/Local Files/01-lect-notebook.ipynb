There's a lot of lame nostalgia. There are quite a few guffaws recalling jokes (practical and otherwise)perpetrated - back then. But you had to have been there to appreciate all the basically good ol' boy camaraderie. If you weren't actually a part of that scene, all this joshing and jostling will fall flat.If you want to actually hear some of these comics' routines - you will have to look elsewhere.\""

The whole cast shines in this film-now I want to see the original again and the play. I wouldn't expect so many people and critics to enjoy this but they did! The music numbers esp. are really good, some actors I never imagined could sing, surprised me, because they could.Anyone who doesn't like musicals, should at least give this chance, but don't expect a scene-for-scene remake of the 1988 version, this one stands alone.\",\n",

Then, while waiting in the interminable lines, we pulled it out of our backpack and read the anecdotes to each other. This made our trip to Disneyland far more interesting than it otherwise would have been (i.e. without the book handy, we would've been at a loss to remember the location of Walt's private apartment above the Fire House, and the forbidden door of Club 33--the snobbiest thing I've ever heard of in my life).After reading the book, I have both more and less respect for the way Disneyland does business. More, in the sense that when they believe they're in the right, they fight for it in court; and less, seeing how guests are maniupulated and employees abused.\",\n",

Jody writes out of his experience especially to other White Christians in America, giving Biblical, historical, personal, and and social reasons to examine racism and work for reconciliation.
